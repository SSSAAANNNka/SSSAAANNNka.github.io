 ## How i spend my last week 

1. The first and I thought the most important that I made a lot of laboratory works.
2. Thanks to the implementattion of point 1 I got a lot of free time and I could to play the guitar.
3. I spend some time to read the books and pass the course in the Internet.

 ## My review of the week

I think the week has been quite productive. I did all homework not only for this week, but also for the next week. I got a lot of free time and spend it with benefit for me. I also didn't forget about rest and I watched videos on Youtube and read books.
